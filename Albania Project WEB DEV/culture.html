            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Albanian culture has deep roots in its history, being a mixture of ancient traditions and influences from such a diversified past. The Albanian language, one of the oldest in Europe, plays the core role in uniting people. Religion is diverse, with a mix of Islam, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Catholicism, although it has traditionally been marked by tolerance. Family is considered the cornerstone of Albanian society, and hospitality, loyalty, and respect for the elderly are strong social features. Traditional practices, like besa-a moral code dealing with trust and hospitality-are still at the core of everyday life, especially in rural settings. Festivals like Nowruz and Saint George's Day are celebrated with great enthusiasm, and the Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival is a major cultural event, showcasing Albania's rich folk music and dance heritage.</p>
